Well on the basis that the first people to stumble across this site will be my children, hi kids.

Still here? Well, you have reached the Jekyll blog site of Lee Chase, and given how little blogging I have done over my career as a software developer you may be looking at the most interesting part of this site. If not and you find something useful, well I'd be happy for you to tweet me a thank you.

Well, I best start blathering on about something, can't hang about all day you know. Hopefully, the humour will be kept to a minimum, given the example in the previous sentence.
